# Motivation and Background

Currently, a number of features which are common in other learning management systems, such as computing a student's final grade, can only be done in PrairieLearn by downloading the raw data. This RFC proposes an interface that adds a full gradebook, with functionality starting from what is proposed in issue #3606. This would allow instructors to save time by doing tasks which were previously only possible externally directly in the web interface.
